TopCoder marathon match problem


Don't forget that there is dependency on Ant library

TODO:
- overhead parameter : issue
- beam width depends from iteration to iteration
- increase at the end
- even/odd number of cols/rows add to heuristic
- for Board_Reduce figure out Empty and Total Space. one of filled_space_ and empty_space_ should not be needed

## Notes:
- "scores" folder is for all the solutions, have to keep it to not run all the solutions every time.
- idea to sync with topcoder cpu. turn parameters for your own cpu. run with factored parameters on their cpu. turn factor to comply with time limit.
